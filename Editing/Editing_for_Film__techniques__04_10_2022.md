  can be used to build contrast, or for it's ease of conveying multilayered action - showing many places at once

## 3. Techniques

* ### **`Eyeline match`** - cutting to an object of character's attention 

    **Building intrigue**:

  * wait to reveal what the character sees (long hold on the character, then cut to what they see)

  * don't reveal what the character sees, and solely focus on emotions beeing conveyed ("Pulp Fiction" - briefcase inspection scene)

* ### **`Cross cutting`** - cutting between different scenes

* ### **`Eye trace`** - guiding viewer's eyes within a shot (see "Mad Max: Fury Road")

* ### **`Split edits`**: J-cut & L-cut

  Good use in dialogue scenes to let the viewer know through rushing autio, that there are two peaople talking.

  In dialuge scenes we can catch reaction of the person not talking at the moment

* ### **`Intellectual montage`** - make cut more noticeable

  Putting seamingly unrelated immages together, to give off a certain feeling or idea - making use of the Kuleshov Effect

* ### **`Cut on action`** - make cut less noticable, smother transition
