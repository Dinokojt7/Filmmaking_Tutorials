# "Save the cat" Story Beats movie breakdown: Bourne Identity (2002):

## 1. **Opening image `[1]`**

Underwater, tilted shot of unconscious Bourne floating belly up in the sea. The sea is storming.

* Water might symbolize birth / rebirth.
* Bourne the CIA Asset dies, and a new person in **bourne**.
* The storm symbolizes events to come / Bourne's state of mind.

## 2. **Theme stated `[5]`**

Jason is saved by fishermen.

Doctor Fisherman: **"Who are you soldier?"**

* Theme: "Search for identity. Who was I? Do I really want to know who I was?"

## 3. **Set up `[1-10]`**

Jason is on his way to a bank in Zurich.

He is pure intuition at this point.

A flaw is introduced: **he is overly aggresive**. (Puts two police officers in hospital, just because he felt slightly threatened by them).

He is essentially a "loaded weapon with a broken trigger." He will have to learn how to control his intuition.

We see that Json is extremely confused by his new found abilities. Frightened even.

## 4. **Catalyst `[12]`**

Bourne visits the bank in Zurich. He hoped to find his identity, but paradoxically he found several (no way of telling which is true) and a gun.

The action of visiting the bank allowed the CIA Treadstone team to locate Bourne. The manhunt begins. CIA sends the other Treadstone Assets after Jason. They want him dead, and he doesn't even know about them.

## 5. **Debate `[12-25]`**

Bourne is even more confused by the contents of he's bank locaker. He hasitates what to do next, where to go. What to take with him. **He decides not to take a gun.**

Bourne is semi-subconcously choosing to distance himself from violence. He's resisting he's violent instincts.

He decides to further investigate one of his identities in Paris - Jason Bourne. But firs he needs to escape the Switzerland authorities. **He again chooses here not to kill anybody.**

## 6. **Break Into Two `[25]`**

Bourne pays Marrie to drive him to Paris.

## 7. **B Story `[30]`**

The drive itself is an excuse to further devlop Bourne's charater - we understand the way he thinks now as he explains it to Marrie.

This is where Jason's and Marrie's romantic side-story begins.

## 8. **Fun and Games `[30-55]`**

Jason and Marrie visit Mr. Bourne's house in parris.
Action, action, car chase, emotional moment for both characters. Marrie decides to stick by Bourne until he figures out who he is.

## 9. **Midpoint `[55]`**

Point of no return for Bourne. False victory - he finds out who he is, but what he finds is terryfing.

Bourne and Marrie discover the truth. Bourne finds he's identity - he is an assasin.

## 10. **Bad Guys Close In `[55-75]`**

Bourne and Marrie hide out in the country - her brother's house.

## 11. **All is Lost `[75]`**

In relative safety of the new hideout Bourne reflects on his quest for identity. He share's he's internal struggle with Marrie.

Bourne: "All the things I've learned I want to forget."

## 12. **Dark Night of the Soul `[75-85]`**

Another CIA Treadstone assasin tracks the pair down. This time Marrie's brother's family is in danger. Bourne faces the assailant once again using the skills he obtained in the previous life.

Marrie leaves with her family.

Bourne once again is all alone.

## 13. **Break Into Three `[85]`**

Jason talks directly to the CIA people hunting him down for the first time since his memory loss (start of the movie).

Jason switches chooses a new objective and remains a proactive protagonist.

Jason stops running - he is going to face his opponents directly, but first he takes command of his situation - he dictates the rules of the game now.

## 14. **Finale `[85-110]`**

Jason, now fully ready (aware of his unique skillset), faces he's opponents.

Jason faces he's opponent's alone. We show it from their perspective - more scarry.

* Five distinct sub-beats:

  * **GATHER A TEAM `[86]`:**
    * Jason formulates a plan and dictates the rules of engagement to his opponents.
  * **EXECUTE THE PLAN `[92]`:** 
    * Jason outsmarts he's opponents with pretend meet-up in a public place - now he know's who to look for.
  * **HIHG TOWER SUPRISE `[95]`:**
    * Jason comes face to face with he's former boss. He learns the whole painfull truth about he's past. He's a CIA assasin.
    * Unexpectedly Jason former boss activates a silent allarm and Jason has to once again fight for he's life - this time he does't run.
