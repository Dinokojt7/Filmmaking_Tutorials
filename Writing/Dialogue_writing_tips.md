# Dialogue

There seem to be many approaches to writing good dialogue. Some more academic, some more stylistic and some just realistic.

    *   Three Questions (David Mamet method):

        1. Who wants what from who?
        2. What happens if they don't get it?
        3. Why now?

    *   Jerry B. Jenkins method:

        1. Cut dialogue to the bone.
        2. Use dialogue to reveal backstory.
        3. Use dialogue to reveal character.
        4. Be subtle. (subtext, sidestepping, silence)

        5. Read your dialogue aloud.
        6. Create a 'Make My Day' moment.
