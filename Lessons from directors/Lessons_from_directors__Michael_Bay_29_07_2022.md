## **BAYHEM**

everyting feels big and significant

---

### 1. **Camera**

* **`Intence camera movement`**
* **`Low angle shots`** - people and objects seem giant
* **`Entertaining shots`** - "fealing frames with entertainment value ~ Filmento"

    *Example (Movie "Ambulance" 2022 - Drone FPV "First Person View" shot):*  

        new technology for the film industry == excitement/hype/entertainment

        Shot description:
        drone flying low over a bridge and diving under the bridge to follow a speeding car)

---

### 2. **Narrative/Script**

* **`Piling problems`** - multiple problems at the same time == more thrill and entertainment value

    *Example (Movie "Ambulance" 2022):*

        1. Sick wife
        
            ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
            
            - money needed for life saving surgery

        >>>

        2. Bank heist - simple in theory (get money & drive away)

            PROBLEMS:

            - Police special forces unit ready to ambush the bank heist crew
            - A cop enters the bank during a heist
            - Getaway car has engine trouble
            - Another Cop comes to check out the geteway car

            >

            - Crew gets killed
            - Main characters get trapped inside a building
            - Police special forces unit moves in
            - Main Character SHOOTS A COP TWICE !!!

        >>>

        3. "5 star" Police chase

            PROBLEMS:
            
            - HELICOPTERS - can't escape
            - DYING COP (he dies == they die) inside the getaway car - ambulance
            - Hostages: DYING COP, Paramedic (EMT)
            - Easly indentifiable car - titular ambulance

        4. Surgery on the DYING COP 

            PROBLEMS:

            - Police car chase - not ideal situation for surgery
            - Paramedic not qualified to do surgery
            - Surgents helping the Paramedic with the surgery through facetime cut out in the worst moment
            - DYING COP wakes up in the middle of the surgery
            - Bullet in the COP's spleen > spleen erupts right when doctors loose conection with the Paramedic

        5. Police kill box - they think the hostage COP has died

            PROBLEMS:

            - Everybody in the ambulance might get killed by snipers
            - Police car chase

        6. Cartel helps main characters escape

            PROBLEMS:

            - Cartel boss'es son gets killed in the diversion > Boss wants revenge on top of the money
            - Paramedic shoots one of the main characters in the chest


        7. Will shot in the chest

            PROBLEMS:

            - Police car chase once again - shootout with the cartell drew them in again
            - The paramedic has to keep Will alive or she might get killed by Donie
            - The paramedic has to hide the fact she shot Will or she WILL BE KILLED BY Donie

* **`Extreme to the max`** - push whatever you put in the script to the extreme, higher stakes, more rewarding overcoming the obstacle

    *Example (Movie "Ambulance" 2022):*

        1. EXTREMERYLY brutal car crash (Paramedic introduction scene):

            little girl + impalement by an iron bar

            * Casulty - little girl (the worst posible person to experience a car crash)
            * Injury - impalement by an iron bar (bloody, graphic, traumatic, one of the worst possible injuries for the child) 
        
        2. EXTREMELY bad ending to the bank heist

            heist crew + brutal deaths

            * getting run over by a getaway car - crashed legs
            * Head blown off mid-sentence (sudden, brutal, serious)
            * bleeding out on the sidewalk after getting filled with led by the LAPD and crawiling over broken glass

        3. EXTREMELY brutal way to loose the police chase

            police roadblock + decoy ambulance filled with C4, cartell murder mobile

        4. EXTREME emotions in the ambulance (uncontained emotions - shouting, wide eyes, rapid movements, hearts pounding, fast breaths)

            agitated main characters + extreme circumstances

            * Danny - extreme anger, stress
            * Paramedic - extreme fear, stress
            * Will - extreme divide between trying to "keeping it together" and guilt, stress  

        5. EXTREME character motivations

            * COP Partner - fear & regret (is the reason for his partner's situation, not just a partner because that would just be concern & revenge)
            * Paramedic - fear for her own life
            * Danny - life behind bars & his brother's life and family
            * Will - his family & his brother's life & regret for shooting the COP & regret for taking hostages

    Note: police Boss with the dog has poor motivation, he's just doing his job, but the FBI agent has a personal link with the main character, kind of a rivalry relationship, not much but beats the regular work motivation

* **`Doing things for real`** - finding the most impactfull way of doing things, practical effects, no greenscreens

    *Example (Movie "Heat" 1995):*

        Filming a shootout with blanks in a real city block. The actions seems impactful, emotions more realistic, and the autio can't be faked... [go watch Heat!]

* **`Extra, unbelonging variables`** - CONTRAST for extra ENTERTAINMENT VALUE
  * comedic effect
  * something to break monotony (feeling only the thrill might be worse than beeing put on a rollercoster of emotions - it might sometimes be benefitial to "reset" the audience before further action insues)
    
    *Example (Movie "Ambulance" 2022):*

        CONTRAST: small grandma + giant, armed robbers
        
        A small grandma enters an elevator full of bank robbers ready to strike

        ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: rollercoster of emotions - thrill > laughter > more thrill

    *Example (Movie "Ambulance" 2022):*

        CONTRAST: police car chase + criminals listening to chill music
        
        Criminals try to chill out during the car chase using some tunes. Alowes us to just for a second break the monotony of the car chase. Shows us that the brothers like the same music. Allows us to celebrate, even if for a second, overcoming a extreme amount of problems.

        ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: rollercoster of emotions - long thrill > chill > more thrill; celebration

  * adding depth to otherwise flat characters
    
    *Example (Movie "Ambulance" 2022):*

        CONTRAST: giant police Chief in a small car with his dog by his side

        The police Chief cares for his dog imencely going as far as prioritizing dog's safety over the chase. The Chef's car choice is never commented/laughed upon - he is comfortable and confident in his choices, answers to no one, HE IS IN CHARGE!

        ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: big man + small car, DOG :)

  * cool looking visuals
  
    *Example (Movie "Heat" 1995):*
 
        CONTRAST: color clashing with surounding area color scheme 

        Incredibly bright yellow, eye-catching sand mount in the background of an extreme wide shot.

        ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: The mound grips viewer's attention, adds a sence of "dreamyness" to the scene
